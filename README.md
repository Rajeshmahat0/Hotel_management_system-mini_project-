🍴 Project Overview
This project is a basic console application where users can order food items from a restaurant menu. It features a straightforward ordering process and calculates the total bill for the customer. It’s a great example of how you can use Python to manage simple user interactions and perform basic operations.

🚀 Key Features
Interactive Menu: Displays available food items and prices.
Order Management: Allows users to add items to their order and provides real-time feedback.
Total Calculation: Computes the total amount due based on user selections.

🧩 How It Works
Display the Menu: Shows the list of available items with their prices.
Take Orders: Users can enter the names of the items they wish to order or type 'done' to finish.
Check Availability: Ensures the item is on the menu and adds it to the order if available.
Calculate Total: Sums up the costs of the ordered items and presents the total amount
